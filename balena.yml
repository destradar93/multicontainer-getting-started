  This example will get you up and running quickly with a multicontainer setup on balena. 
  The application creates a plot of your device's CPU load average and memory usage at the device's public URL, which is piped over using websockets. 
  The system is composed of a simple static site server, a websocket server, and a proxy. 
  These 3 components are defined in the docker-compose.yml as services and are only given as much privilege as is needed. Have fun!

  ## Usage instructions

  It should take a few minutes for your project to build. While you wait, you can enable device URLs, so you can see the server outside of our local network. 
  This option can be found in the Actions drop down in your device dashboard.
